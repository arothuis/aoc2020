## Purpose
1. Finish the daily exercises in JavaScript
2. Apply a declarative style as much as possible: favor functions and expressions over statements and statefulness
    * Although in other cases frowned upon, we allow the comma operator for binding variables in expressions
3. Decompose into small, testable functions
4. Extensively test the implementation, preferably using Test-Driven Development (red, green, refactor)
